# Challenge Assignment 3
## This challenge assignment required me to make a random password generator with JavaScript that prompts the user for the number of characters for the password and multiple criteria for the password as well. These criteria include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, and numbers. Once the user input is received the password generator will create a randomized password completely custom to the user's criteria.
